# ðŸ”§ Field Mapping Issue - FIXED!

## The Problem
Your frontend was sending client data with these field names:
- `name` (combined first and last name)
- `loanAmount` 
- `loanType`
- `amountPaid`

But your Supabase database schema expected:
- `first_name` and `last_name` (separate fields)
- `loan_amount`
- `loan_type` 
- `amount_paid`

## The Fix
Added field mapping in `supabase_database.py`:

### On CREATE:
- Splits `name` â†’ `first_name` + `last_name`
- Maps `loanAmount` â†’ `loan_amount`
- Maps `loanType` â†’ `loan_type`
- Maps `amountPaid` â†’ `amount_paid`

### On READ:
- Combines `first_name` + `last_name` â†’ `name`
- Maps `loan_amount` â†’ `loanAmount`
- Maps `loan_type` â†’ `loanType`
- Maps `amount_paid` â†’ `amountPaid`

## Test Your Fix:
1. **Go to your frontend**: https://cashflow-crm.vercel.app/crm
2. **Add a new client** using the form
3. **Check Supabase**: Should see the client in your database
4. **Refresh frontend**: Should see the client in your CRM

Your forms should now work perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
