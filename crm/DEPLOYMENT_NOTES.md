# Vercel Deployment Fix for React 19 + react-beautiful-dnd

## Current Issue
React 19 + react-beautiful-dnd compatibility issue causing Vercel builds to fail.

## Primary Solution: .npmrc file
The .npmrc file with `legacy-peer-deps=true` should resolve this.

## Backup Solution: Replace react-beautiful-dnd
If the .npmrc doesn't work, we can replace react-beautiful-dnd with @dnd-kit/core which is React 19 compatible:

1. Remove react-beautiful-dnd:
   npm uninstall react-beautiful-dnd

2. Install @dnd-kit alternatives:
   npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities

3. Update KanbanBoard.jsx to use @dnd-kit instead

This would require code changes but ensures React 19 compatibility.

## Current Status
- Added .npmrc with legacy-peer-deps=true
- This should allow Vercel to build successfully
- No code changes needed with this approach
